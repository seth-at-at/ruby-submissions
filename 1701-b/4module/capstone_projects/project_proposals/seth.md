### Project Template

### Favorites Folders

### Pitch

1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?
It is an application that lets you sort through your favorited and liked images in a sorted manner allowing you to find certain images faster

### Problem

People have been asking for 2+ years for the site to implement a feature that allows you to put favorites into folders. They haven't responded yet so I decided to use the api to create my own app for it.

### Solution

My application will solve it by using the api to pull in users data and create a folder that you can name and set a dashboard image that will have the folder title above it.

### Target Audience

Anyone who uses the original website

### New Techniques

Which new techniques are you hoping to implement?
Parsing an api that gives you the info through the front end instead of the backend, creating dropdown on image click where your mouse is.

### Workflow

What project management tool will you be using to manage your progress?
Waffle.
